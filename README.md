# Bike Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes bike sales data using Excel pivot tables to understand better revenue, cost, and profit for various countries over different years and months.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains the following key information:
- **Countries:** Countries where bike sales occurred (and in the drop-down of each country it shows the states in which sales occurred also)
- **Revenue, Cost, and Profit:** Financial performance for each country.
- **Years and Months:** The sales data is organized by year (columns) and by month (rows), alongside countries.

## Analysis Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** 
   - The raw data was rough and required cleaning and organization.
   - Pivot tables matched countries to their respective revenues, costs, and profits.
  
2. **Pivot Table Design:**
   - **Columns:** Represent different years of sales.
   - **Rows:** Represent countries and months, providing a breakdown of sales performance over time.
  
3. **Insights:**
   - This analysis makes it easier to observe trends such as revenue growth or decline over specific years and months, as well as profit margins across different countries.

## File Contents
- **Bike_Sales_Analysis.xlsx:** The Excel file contains the cleaned data and pivot tables for bike sales by country, year, and month.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for creating and analyzing pivot tables)
